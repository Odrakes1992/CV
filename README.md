**Osneil Drakes** (***Tax Advisor turned Software Engineer***)

**Profile**

I started my professional career in finance after studying History at university. I gravitated towards the problem solving, the research and the opportunity to learn. As I was studying I was introduced to the regulatory/tax side of the tech indurstry and really enjoyed its changing and wide-ranging nature. I decided to make the career change because I wanted a new challenge and something new to learn. I have just finished the Makers Academy Bootcamp which focussed on Test Driven Development, Pair Programming and Agile software development using some of the stack shown below. I also picked up some mentees along the way - 4 and counting!

**Work Experience**

**Saffery Champness, Jeffreys Henry and Grant Thornton (August 2015 to July 2021)Tax Consultant**

- During my time in professional services, I worked primarily in private client tax, whilst working to qualify as a chartered tax advisor. 

- My day to day role varied depending on the client but primarily I provided tax advice to UK and non-UK high net worth individuals, liased with HMRC and foreign tax authorities on behalf of my clients dealing with the UK and overseas tax affairs. 

- I also handled my portfolio's administration and regulatory requirements, this often including dealing third parties. 

- Finally I led the department's technical analysis of the 2017 legislative changes to the taxation of non-domiciliaries enforced in April 2019.


**The Lada Rally  (August 2017 to August 2021)
Co-founder, Logistics and Partnership Lead**

- The Lada Rally was a social enterprise that raised funds to help displaced refugees who had settled in Greece. Through our annual charity race we were able to provide funds to the charities working on the front line but also raise awareness of the work these charities were doing.

- I focused on the logistical side of operations, ensuring all participants had the necessary documents for travel throughout Europe and purchases of suitable vehicles. Though the focus was on fun, staying safe and compliant was key to the the Rally's success.

- Given my financial training I oversaw all annual accounting and tax obligations for the enterprise, and also supported my co-founders in sourcing external corporate partnerships to support the enterprise. Ben & Jerry's provided support through their refugee initiatives.

**Skills**

**Problem Solving**

Problem solving has been a key skill in learning to code at Makers, and will continue to be a key skill in software development. I have learnt that there is usually more than one solution to a problem and through debugging, research and code reviews I have found that I always reach a solution to the issue at hand. This is one of the transferrable skills that I picked up in my university degree where not only was I required to process a lot of information and determine what was relevant but know where to look to find the relevant information. This improved my researching skills, which have been very useful as the problem solving process tends to involve research to both understand the problem and find other tried and tested methods. 

**Fast Learner**

During my time studying for my professional qualifications, I was expected to fulfil my normal day to day role. I found that as I studied and started to understand the complicated tax concepts I applied what I learned to my role. Once I had found my niche, I developed the confidence to explain these concepts to junior members of the team and became the go-to person for all related queries. As a part of the Makers Bootcamp I was introduced to many different technologies and concepts in a short space of time, for my final project I worked with Python and Django to deliver our product. This was a steep learning curve having not worked with either language and framework previously, but our final product is testatment to my ability to process a lot of new information in a short space of time. 

**Collaboration**

Teamwork has always been integral to every role that I have had in my professional career. Outside of my day to day role when working with the other founding members of the Lada Rally, we would not have been able to deliver a successful and safe event without each founding member collaborating and communicating, especially as these events were in a foreign country with no familiarity with the contestants. These contestants relied wholly on us and with open and honest communication we were able to help them feel at ease. Separately being a teamplayer was integral to succeeding at Makers from pair-programming to the group projects, during the latter I ensured that each member of the team felt like their voices were heard and supported team members where I could.
