Osneil Drakes 

Chartered tax advisor turned software developer. 

**Profile**




After a few painstaking years of studying to pass the Chartered Tax Advisor professional qualification, I wanted a new challenge. 

Having completed the Makers Academy bootcamp, I am now looking for my first role as a Junior Developer, where I can continue learning about clean code, TDD, whilst also picking up a few new languages. 

I have just finished the Makers Academy Bootcamp. The bootcamp focussed on Test Driven Development, Pair Programming and Agile software development using some of the stack show above. I also picked up some mentees along the way - 4 and counting!

**Work Experience**

**Saffery Champness, Jeffreys Henry and Grant Thornton (August 2015 to July 2021)Tax Consultant**

During my time in professional services, I worked primarily in private client tax, whilst working to qualify as a chartered tax advisor. 

My day to day role varied depending on the client but primarily I provided tax advice to UK and non-UK high net worth individuals, liased with HMRC and foreign tax authorities on behalf of my clients dealing with the UK and overseas tax affairs. 

I also handled my portfolio's administration and regulatory requirements, this often including dealing third parties. 

Finally I led the department's technical analysis of the 2017 legislative changes to the taxation of non-domiciliaries enforced in April 2019.


**The Lada Rally  (August 2017 to present)
Co-founder, Logistics and Partnership Lead**

The Lada Rally is a social enterprise that raised funds to help displaced refugees who had settled in Greece. Through our annual charity race we were able to provide funds to the charities working on the front line but also raise awareness of the work these charities were doing.

I focused on the logistical side of operations, ensuring all participants had the necessary documents for travel throughout Europe and purchases of suitable vehicles. Though the focus was on fun, staying safe and compliant was key to the the Rally's success.

Given my financial training I oversaw all annual accounting and tax obligations for the enterprise, and also supported my co-founders in sourcing external corporate partnerships to support the enterprise. Ben & Jerry's provided support through their refugee initiatives.
